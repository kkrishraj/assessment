Your Task:
Objective: Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and a MySQL database.
 
Requirements:
Set up a Spring Boot application:
Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializer or your preferred method.
Add dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL Driver.

Database Configuration:
Set up a MySQL database and configure your Spring Boot application to connect to it.

Entity Creation:
Create an entity class (e.g., User) with appropriate fields (e.g., id, name, email, age).

Repository Layer:
Create a repository interface that extends JpaRepository for the entity class.

Service Layer:
Implement a service layer that contains business logic for handling CRUD operations.

Controller Layer:
Create a REST controller that exposes endpoints for each CRUD operation:
Create a new user (POST)
Get all users (GET)
Get a user by ID (GET)
Update a user (PUT)
Delete a user (DELETE)

Testing:
Ensure that each endpoint works correctly by testing with tools like Postman or through integration tests.
Additional Improvements (Optional but encouraged):
Implement validation for the entity fields.
Add error handling to manage scenarios such as entity not found.
Document your API using Swagger or a similar tool.
Implement pagination and sorting for the list of users.

Test Request: 
1. create user: localhost:8091/api/users - POST METHOD
   {"name":"test1","email":"test@test.com","age":22}
2. get specific user by id: localhost:8091/api/users/2  -  GET METHOD
3. Update specific user by id: localhost:8091/api/users/2  -   PUT METHOD
   {"name":"testdfd1","email":"test@test.com","age":22}
4. Delete user: localhost:8091/api/users/2   -  DELETE METHOD
